      <h1>The team behind VestezenGames</h1>

      <p>
        VestezenGames is just me, Erik, a slightly obsessed software engineer who
        loves idle games, progression systems, and watching numbers go
        stupidly high. I like building games that feel good from the very
        first tap – where every upgrade actually does something and you always
        have a clear next goal.
      </p>

      <h2>What I’m trying to build</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is pretty simple: make mobile games that respect your time,
        don’t feel predatory, and still give you that
        <em> “just one more upgrade”</em> feeling. No forced grind walls,
        no weird traps – just clean, transparent systems that reward you for
        playing.
      </p> 

      <h2>Why I care about this game</h2>
      <p>
        Idle Wizard: Magic Ascension is basically what i want in a idle RPG.
        I wanted a game where you can jump in for a few minutes, make progress,
        and leave feeling stronger – but also one where long-term players have
        builds to experiment with and goals to chase for weeks.
      </p>

      <h2>Thanks for being here</h2>
      <p>
        If you downloaded the game, tested it, or even just scrolled this far:
        thank you. Indie games live and die on small communities, reviews, and
        word of mouth. If you enjoy the game, a short review or sharing it with
        a friend genuinely helps a lot more than it looks on the surface.
