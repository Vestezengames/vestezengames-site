        I’m always interested in how the game feels to play – what’s fun,
        what’s annoying, and what you’d like to see next.

      <p>
        A small Discord community is planned for the future. Until then, the
        best way to support the game is by leaving a review on Google Play,
        sharing it with a friend, or reaching out through the store page.
